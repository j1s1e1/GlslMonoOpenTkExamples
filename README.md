GlslMonoOpenTkExamples
======================

Tests of GLSL functions with OpenTK in mono

These files were based on C tutorials at http://www.arcsynthesis.org/gltut/index.html developed by Jason L. McKesson.  
I had completed most of the conversions to C# and Android, then I had a really bad hard drive crash, and I am in the 
process of recreating the conversions from damaged files.

This set of files requires OpenTK 1.1 libraries.  Projects should build in Visual Studio, but I'm using Monodevelop on 
Fedora 20, so the forms may not show up until the program is run.  Additional tutorials are just added to an enum, so 
the form is pretty simple.

I don't expect anyone will really be interested in this, I just filled this out in case someone finds this searching for 
examples.
